# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
<br>
Objective: Develop an AI-based model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.
<br>
Motivation: Early detection of diabetes can significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce complications.
<br>
Solution: Use machine learning algorithms trained on medical data (e.g., glucose levels, BMI, age) to identify patterns associated with diabetes.
Benefits:
<br>
    >Enables early diagnosis and proactive health management
    <br>
    >Increases diagnostic accuracy compared to manual methods
    <br>
    >Supports healthcare professionals in decision-making
<br>
Outcome: A predictive tool that can assist in screening individuals at risk for diabetes using accessible clinical data.
